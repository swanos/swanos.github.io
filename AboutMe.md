## Education

I spent over half my life studying primary and secondary education at **St. Ursula**, a catholic school in Indonesia. Graduating from high school during a global pandemic, I started college online at **Deakin College** studying **Diploma of IT**. Early 2022, I obtained my diploma and started my **Computer Science** course at **Deakin University**.

## Work Experience

My first job ever was on retail selling ceramicware for a coffee exhibition in Indonesia. I worked another customer service role at KFC for a few months, before starting my first IT role as an intern at **DeakinTalent's FreelancingHUB**. I also got the opportunity to work with **Thoth Tech** as part of my course, where I gained some experience in developing software (arcade games, in particular) and writing documentations.

## Hobbies

Aside programming, I also like playing music. I mainly play the **piano** which I have learned since I was 5 years old. I also play the **violin**, which is my instrument in the orchestras I joined from middle school until college. After moving to Melbourne I contributed to the orchestra online **video editting** - another hobby of mine.
